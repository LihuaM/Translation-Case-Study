# Translation-Case-Study

* The overall conversion rate  with localized translation is lower than without localized  translation.

  After excluding Spain data, the conversion for localized translation (i.e. test=1) is 4.3%, while the conversion for non-localized translation is 4.8%.

* Argentina and Uruguay have relatively lower conversion rate than other countries,
  so we need to check if these two sample sizes are balanced with other samples. In our test experiment,
  while Uruguay only accounts for 1.7% of total observations, 17.3% of observations are collected from Argentina. The result from Argentina's data will impact the overall results.

* If the hypothesis testing is run on the country level, conversion rate for all
  individual country is not significantly different between localized and non-localized
  translation.
